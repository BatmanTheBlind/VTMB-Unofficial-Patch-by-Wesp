This folder is required to make NPC floats playable for female PC.

It may also contain .wav and .lip files that'll override ones in parent directory
when we're playing by female character. For localization purposes, it may be used
to change captions' words endings (and/or whole sounds) on appealing to female PC.

Note that ALL file-set of certain sound type must be included here - f.e., if you
even changed one line of float_# type, you MUST include all float_# rest from the 
parent folder here too (lips+wavs and from #1 to last), otherwise they won't play!

If you don't change anything, this folder *should* exist, but must be empty.
