During one of my nightly sessions I noticed another vampire sneaking around who looked like a Lasombra to me. Luckily I recently learned Obfuscate and so could avoid being spotted. Curious about what he was doing here in LA and whether it's about our coffin I'll shadow him the next few days."

I'm pretty sure he failed turning the Caitiff, I don't know about the black guy. This doesn't affect the sarcophagus thing, but I still got a bad feeling with him always returning to the library. As I'm not a fighter myself I will contact and ask Beckett about it."

I overheard that he wants to meet someone at the end of the Santa Monica pier and this should be the Lasombra. I hope he'll start from the smoke shop so Beckett and I can easily trail him to the guy!"
