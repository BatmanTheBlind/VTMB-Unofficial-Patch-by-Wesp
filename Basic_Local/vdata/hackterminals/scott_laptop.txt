I'll better follow him around the next few nights."

I'm pretty sure he failed turning the junkyard guy, but I don't know about the other one. This doesn't affect the sarcophagus thing, but I still got a bad feeling with him always returning to the library. As I'm not a fighter myself I will contact and ask Beckett about it."
