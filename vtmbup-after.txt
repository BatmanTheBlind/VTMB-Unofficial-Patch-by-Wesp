To play the Unofficial Patched version of the game
RUN BLOODLINES FROM THE LINKS THAT THE PATCH MADE!

If you want to play directly from the Steam client
ADD -game Unofficial_Patch TO IT'S LAUNCH OPTIONS.

After switching from the original game to basic or
plus versions YOU ALWAYS NEED TO START A NEW GAME!

If you are RUNNING IN A WINE environment start the
game using "loader-linux.sh" from the main folder.

In case you experience INCREASED NUMBERS OF RANDOM
BUGS, save, exit the game, restart it, and reload!

To IMPROVE THE VISUALS check out the shader suites
in Patch_Extras/Player Mods or use your GPU panel.
