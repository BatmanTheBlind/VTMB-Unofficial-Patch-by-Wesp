To play the Unofficial Patched version of the game
RUN BLOODLINES FROM THE LINKS THAT THE PATCH MADE!

If you want to play directly from the Steam client
ADD -game Unofficial_Patch TO IT'S LAUNCH OPTIONS!

After switching from the original game to basic or
plus versions YOU ALWAYS NEED TO START A NEW GAME!

In case you experience INCREASED NUMBERS OF RANDOM
BUGS, save, exit the game, restart it, and reload.

If you are RUNNING IN A WINE environment start the
game using "loader-linux.sh" from the main folder!

If you want to add minor mods like texture/models/
audio YOU SHOULD INSTALL THEM TO THE PATCH FOLDER.
