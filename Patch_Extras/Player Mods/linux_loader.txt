bloodlines_loader.sh [mod_name]

Script for running Bloodlines in a Wine / Linux environment.

Place this script into the directory where Vampire.exe resides or one of its subdirectories. It needs to be executable. To use it, you can either:

• Click it in the file explorer. This requires the GUI builder Zenity installed.

• From the command line: Open a console and execute the script. Zenity is not required or used.

If there are mods installed, it will show the mods and allow the user to select one; if not it will run the original game. You can also use a mod name as a command-line argument to directly start with this mod.

Created by SCO; improved to work from subdirectories by Wrzlprmft; readme improved by Wesp5 and Wrzlprmft


This script from Uradamus runs Bloodlines directly from Steam:

#!/bin/bash

# Change this to match your own prefix.
PREFIX="$HOME/wine"

# This assumes you installed Steam in its default location.
cd "$PREFIX/drive_c/Program Files/Steam"

export WINEARCH=win32
export WINEPREFIX="$PREFIX"
export WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dbghelp=n,b" #VTMB specific fix.

wine Steam.exe -no-dwrite
