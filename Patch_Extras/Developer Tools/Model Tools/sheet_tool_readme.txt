This is a tool to import one animation into the character sheet of a NPC.


How to use:


Drag the mdl in the first slot or browse for it to use his animation.
Use PC model only! Try using the bruha female or the tremere male for
the animation, the other PC wont transfer nicely.
(bones and weights problems)

Drag the other mdl in the second slot or browse for it to receive the animation.
Can use PC or NPC model.(for the PC, other animations will deform so best use for NPC!)

Dont check anything for male to male or female to female models. If you see some
deformation you could try using <bip0 and pelvis only>.

Or for special transfer like male gangrel  to female gangrel use <bip0 and pelvis only>.

For most of the NPC model it is the ACT_RAGDOLL dying animation who get change. 
I dont see any problem to that.

And i know one model that will need an hexedit for the animation to work.  Maybe 
they are more but most models should work.
