Sheet Tool
----------
This is a tool to set a model animation as the character sheet animation.

How to use:
-----------
Drag the mdl from which to use the animation to the first slot or browse for 
it. Select PC models only! Try using Brujah or Malkavian female or Tremere 
male, most other PCs won't transfer nicely (bones and weights problems).

Drag the target mdl to receive the animation to the second slot or browse 
for it. It can be a PC or NPC model (for PCs other animations may deform 
the result so best use NPC). Then click "Do it" or check options first.

Don't check anything for male to male or female to female models. If you see 
some deformation you could try using the <bip0 and pelvis only> setting. Or 
do so for special transfers like e. g. male gangrel to female gangrel mdl.

For most of the NPC models it is the ACT_RAGDOLL dying animation that is 
changed. I dont see any problem with that as vampires get a burning death.

And I know one model that will need a hexedit for the animation to work.
Maybe they are more, but most models should work fine using this tool.
