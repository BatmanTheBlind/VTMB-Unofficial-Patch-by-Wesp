This is a tool to import animation into the character sheet. The program was written for the missing sheet animation of NPC character when use as PC character.

It copy the first bloc animation of a PC character and paste it into the first animation of any human shape character, mainly NPC but could also be a PC character. For NPC i have found  only 2 goods animations: Female Bruhja(or female Malkavian because of the standard idle) and Male Tremere. Other animations get deform shape because NPC are missing some bones. In the process the other animations on the target Model, if they exist, get deform. It also mean the die animation often change because  the NPC die animation is ,must of the time, the only animation in the mdl. I dont think that's a problem because vampires ended in flames!




How to use:

Drag the model(with the animation you want) into the first slot (or browse for it) then
drag the target model into the second slot (or browse for it).

1.Now choose <bip0 and pelvis> if you want bone distance in only those 2 bones.

2.Or choose <no bones distances> so only the rotation of each bone will be transfer.

3.Or choose nothing to transfer everything.


1 and 2 are for male animation to female animation so deformation will be seen.
3 are male to male and female to female transfer.

For example the gangrel female use option 1 for male gangrel to female gangrel animation.
