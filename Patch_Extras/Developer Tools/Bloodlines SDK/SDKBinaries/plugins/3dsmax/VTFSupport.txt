[3DS Max VTF Texture Support v1.7.5]
==========================================================================
(c)2018 Neil "Jed" Jedrzejewski (jed@wunderboy.org) http:///www.wunderboy.org

[Info]
======

This is a simple Max plug-in to allow Valve VTF texture files to be loaded
into max directly as textures. It supports most of the VTF compression formats.

The plug-in loads the largest image for the first frame of the VTF. If its a
cube/environemt map VTF, it will load the first face. Same for animated textures.
HDR images are downsampled to 8-bit from 16-bit before import.

Textures are converted to and loaded as 32-bit RGBA into Max.

[Supported versions]
====================

3DS Max 9    - 32/64bit
3DS Max 2008 - 32/64bit
3DS Max 2009 - 32/64bit
3DS Max 2010 - 32/64bit
3DS Max 2011 - 32/64bit
3DS Max 2012 - 32/64bit
3DS Max 2017 - 64bit
3DS Max 2018 - 64bit
3DS Max 2019 - 64bit

[Installation]
==============

If you have a previous version of the plug-in installed, please delete it first!
This version has a different filename than older versions so if you already have
vtf.bmi or VTFImporter.bmi in your MAX plug-ins directory, delete it.

Go to the folder that matches your version of 3DS Max. Copy VTFLib.dll in your main
"3DSMax" folder and copy vtfimport.bmi for your version of 3DS Max to your
"3DSMax\plugins" folder.

For 64-bit versions of Max, use VTFLib.dll from the 64-bit folder and
VTFImporterx64.bmi instead

Note: For Max 2017/2018/2019 which are 64-bit by default, the plugin filename is VTFImporter.bmi


[Instructions and Stuff]
========================

Once installed, you should find you can now select VTF files as a bitmap image
source in Max.
