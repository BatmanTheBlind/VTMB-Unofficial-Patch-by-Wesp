[Features]
==========

* SMD triangles are rebuilt as a solid, continuous Editable Poly mesh removing the need for welding.
* Recreates smoothing using vertex normal data.
* Creates a multi/sub-object material and assigns material IDs to faces.
* Creates bone "nodes" and re-builds the skeleton hierarchy.
* Supports import of animation including reference frame only and reversal.
* Option to represent certain bones as dummy objects.
* Skinning of the mesh and skeleton with imported SMD vertex weights.
* Coordinate space mapping to "stand up" models made with Maya.


[Installation]
==============

For 32-bit, copy the SMDExport.dli into your 3DS Max plugins folder.
