I guess it's an old news now when even the unofficial patch 
is more or less complete but here you have a superior dialogue 
editor for Bloodlines with manu useful functions and shortcuts 
that make the editing quick and easy. It is suitable for mere 
corrections or modding of DLG files as well as for localizing. 
Bloodlines Dialogue Editor (BDE) was developed during Bloodlines 
CZ localization project for Czech.
