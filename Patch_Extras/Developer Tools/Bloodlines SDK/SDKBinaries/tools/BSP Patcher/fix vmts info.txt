The mini-guide about how to fix included .vmts to use normal versions from
your mod's materials/ folder instead of pre-included to BSP.

We strongly recommend using automated scripts like "map_fixvmts" and 
"bsp_auto_fix" instead, so this information is more for advanced users.

Once you extracted map contents using "map_extract" script, go to folder
"%mapname%_patch" and find some .vmt file in its materials/ subdirectory.
Open this vmt, and if you see something like the example below, it means
this material was pre-included on map compiling and uneditable by default:

"LightmappedGeneric"
{
	"$baseTexture"  "glass/mirror"
	"$envmap"  "maps/map_name/cubemapdefault"
	"$surfaceprop"  "glass"
	"$envmapmask"  "glass/mirror_ref"
}

The "$envmap" value cues that now it uses the texture generated specially
during this map compiling which placed under materials/maps/map_name/ in
the BSP's virtual file system. Instead of "cubemapdefault" we may see some
numberic names (like "c190_-296_82") that means this material uses texture
which has been compiled from env_cubemap placed on map into these coords.

Value "cubemapdefault" means that image has been compiled from map's skybox,
and often suppose that there were no brushfaces with this material connected
to a normal environment cubemaps. This is Troika's crappy manner too, so it
may be fixed by replacing "cubemapdefault" with closest succes cubemap image.
Just open by turn the images under maps/map_name/ path and see which is it.

Now this is what we sould to do with such material to make it editable within
it's source materials/ subdir and use normal cubemap texture intead default. 
- Make a couple of empty lines in start of your vmt;
- Insert on the first line the text below, and then remove old vmt contents.

"patch"
{
	"include" "glass/mirror"
	"replace"
	{
		"$envmap" "maps/map_name/c190_-296_82"
	}
}

Do that for all that kind of .vmts you found, and then use "map_updater"
script to replace existing content with your edited one. Now map will read
your regular .vmts in moddir/materials/subfolder/texture.vmt and consider 
all changes you did on it (except cubemaps - you may just disable them).

P.S.: We remind you that this procedure can be just performed using the 
"map_fixvmts" script, and the "bsp_auto_fix" script will execute all required
procedures without requiring any user's intervention (just drop .bsp file).
