Info regarding unused Bloodlines musical pieces by Rik Schaffer:

14.01.2018 One final piece posted to Planet Vampire from AngelsForever:
"Innocence Once Lost"- as he (Rik) wrote, this composition was written 
in the same year as "Festival" and is in the same vein.

 Innocence once lost (Unused): Restored to Malkavian Exterior

There is one track that was a potential hub track and didn't fit. When I get 
time in the future I'll look into mixing it. There might be actually two 
pieces left.

I sent you some Bloodlines tracks that were never released, never were used in 
the game (because they didn't quite fit), and that no one has ever heard.

Thank you for contacting me, and yes, they are real and were composed by me in early 2003 for Bloodlines. They are the very last of the unused tracks. Hollywood Hub part 2 and Open Season.

You can use them. All I ask is that they are sent and shared to as many people as possible who enjoy and are moved by the music I created for Bloodlines. Of all the games I have worked on in the 15 years I've been doing this Bloodlines was the best because I was given free reign to write music without censor and drawing from my own life experiences. This is where the best music comes from for an artist.

16.11.2011:

There was talk early on of an East Los Angeles Hub for the game in one of the numerous production meetings I attended at Troika. I was thinking hispanic influence Nines Rodriquez with Open Season. Open Season would have been that area's main theme.

Hollywood Hub part 2 was basically written the same week as the original Hollywood Hub. The name was a working title, and only because I thought that it would fit nicely wherever Troika ended up using the first Hollywood piece. I'm not really sure why it didn't get used, but if you want to stay true to the game I'd use it in Hollywood somewhere (maybe a club, etc.)...

I wish I could help more but its been so many years...  These are the last Bloodlines compositions that exist that haven't been previously released.

 Come Around (Unused): Restored to Public Library
 Downtown Hub (Unused Alternate): Restored to Tutorial
 Hollywood Hub Part 2 (Unused): Restored to Nosferatu Warrens
 Open Season (Unused): Restored to Blood Hunt
 The LaCroix Dream (Unused): Restored to Warehouse
 Tikal Jungle (Unused): Restored to Kamikaze Zen
 Vesuvius (Unused Alternate): Restored to Ground Zer0

Improvements

I recently recieved an e-mail response from Rik Schaffer, the composer of all the original BGM for the game. He was very generous and sent all of the original source wave files that remained in his possession. It wasn't the entire soundtrack, but it was better then nothing. Roughly 17 perfect quality waves were sent. I processed them the same as I did with the tracks in the prior version of this set. I amplified, removed any silence, applied any fades that were required, and encoded to Alt Present Standard. 3 more unused tracks have been added, 1 new boss track has been added which I THINK was indeed used in the game, and 13 low quality tracks have been replaced with fresh high quality versions. So in theory, this is the best version of this soundtrack we will ever have, considering that Troika went out of business, and this contains all the waves Rik still had.

On top of this, my buddy Boxxmann ripped all 9 licensed tracks from the official soundtrack CD which he owns, and sent them to me. The CD only contained those 9 tracks, and none of Rik Schaffer's work. He encoded them to Alt Preset Standard, so they are now flawless quality MP3s.

I'd like to say sorry to everyone that has already downloaded the prior version of this album. I didn't know that this was going to happen. I jumped the gun and released it too early. I hope no one feels like they wasted their time getting the "inferior" version.

Notes
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
The tracks are roughly ordered chronologically in relation to the game's main story. I took the liberty of slightly shuffling things up if too many soft or hard tracks were bunched together. I tried to make it seem like an album that was always rising or diving in terms of energy.

I amplified the levels of as much of the BGM as possible to an appropriate standard so they would blend in better with the loud licensed music. This doesn't mean every track is equally loud. It just means that the softer tracks can be heard, whereas before, they were practically mute in comparison with the licensed songs. I also applied a fade out or removed silence when needed.

I was forced to recompress some of the original BGM tracks due to reasons mentioned above. I did not need to do this on any tracks which I was able to secure from the composer himself, or the official soundtrack CD. I re-encoded to Alt Preset Standard, so the quality loss was kept to a bare minimum.

I did not include the two short "stem" tracks that were entirely rumbling and can't be considered anything close to music.

Some files in the game data folders had more then one song, often times the second song was a duplicate of a song that was already in it's own track, in which case I removed that segment.

I included all of the parts of "The Deb of Night", which was a talk show that played on many of the boom boxes you came across in the game. Any radio station ads that played more then once were edited out. Of all 5 radio station tracks, you should not hear anything more then once.

Yes, Club Glaze has two tracks. Not sure why, because that club doesn't have much reason to stay around long enough for the second song to start.

If a track is played in more then one area in the game, which is very common, I tried to list the most obvious area. For example, the song by "Darling Violetta" is played on the radio at the beach, as well as Empire Hotel.

There are quite a few tracks that are played in so many small forgettable areas, that I just chose to keep their original titles taken from the old file names. It would be too much trouble to list all the areas the song is played, and the filename would be gigantic.

I am not really sure where the "Short Cutscene" tracks are heard in the game. Also, there are five "Unused" tracks which I am pretty sure were not in the final version of the game. These all came from the game's data folders or the composer himself. All of these are included here because this is a "Complete" rip. I gave it my best guess at where they should be placed amungst the track order.
